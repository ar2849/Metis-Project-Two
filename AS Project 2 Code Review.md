# Code Review

### Clean Code

- Follows PEP-8 format
- Combine multiple commands in one cell
- Make sure docstrings are complete
- Minimize repeating code by using functions and formatting
- Consider using .py files/modules to store functions/scripts



### Good Documentation

- More explanation of thought process, including describing/walking through pipelines for scraping/data collection
- More explanation of EDA and why you chose the features that you did for your model, as well as commentary on distribution of feature and target variables, correlations, etc.
- More explanation of your model's performance and insights from cross-validation
- More explanation/commentary on visualizations and insights from viz
- Document conclusions drawn from modeling in notebook or README file
- Use markdown cells for explanations rather than within code cells



### Proper Data Science

- Suggest evaluating appropriateness of model by doing analysis of residuals (e.g. ensuring no heteroskedasticity)
- Suggest further evaluating model using error metric (e.g. RMSE, MAE), comparing train vs. test performance
- State and explain conclusions from EDA, visualizations, and model results
